# C Language Projects and Programs  

This repository contains a collection of C language programs designed to cover a wide range of concepts, from basic programming constructs to advanced algorithms and system-level programming. The purpose of this repository is to serve as a resource for beginners and intermediate programmers to learn and practice C programming, as well as to showcase the practical applications of C in various domains.  

## Repository Structure  

The repository is organized into folders based on the topics and concepts covered:  

1. **Basics**:  
   - Programs that cover basic syntax, input/output, data types, and control structures.  
   - Ideal for beginners starting their journey with C programming.  

2. **Functions and Recursion**:  
   - Examples of user-defined functions, recursion, and modular programming.  

3. **Data Structures**:  
   - Implementation of common data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.  
   - Includes examples of algorithms like sorting and searching.  

4. **Pointers and Memory Management**:  
   - Demonstrates the use of pointers, dynamic memory allocation, and memory management in C.  

5. **File Handling**:  
   - Programs that demonstrate reading from and writing to files, as well as advanced file handling techniques.  

6. **System Programming**:  
   - Examples of system-level programming, including process management, inter-process communication, and handling signals.  

## How to Use  

1. **Clone the Repository**:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/c-language-projects.git
2. Navigate to a Specific Folder:
    ```cd folder-name```

3. Compile and Run the Program:
Use a C compiler such as GCC to compile the programs. For example

```gcc program-name.c -o program-name ``` 
 ```  ./program-name  ```
