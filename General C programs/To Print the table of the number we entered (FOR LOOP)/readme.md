This C program generates and displays the multiplication table of a user-provided number using a `for` loop. It iterates from 1 to 10 and calculates the product of the entered number with the loop index. The output is neatly displayed in a tabular format.

## Key Features:
- **Input:** Prompts the user to enter an integer.
- **Logic:** Utilizes a `for` loop to multiply the input number by values ranging from 1 to 10.
- **Output:** Displays the multiplication table of the entered number.

## Example Usage:

### Input:
```
Please Enter any Value for the number: 7
```

### Output:
```
The table of the number you entered is as follows:
7 X 1 = 7
7 X 2 = 14
7 X 3 = 21
...
7 X 10 = 70
```

## Concepts Used:
- **`for` Loop**: Simplifies repetitive multiplication logic.
- **User Interaction**: Accepts dynamic input and provides relevant output.

### How It Works:
1. Accepts an integer input from the user.
2. Iterates through values 1 to 10 using a `for` loop.
3. Calculates the product and prints each step of the multiplication table.
