## Time Conversion: Hours to Minutes and Seconds  

### Overview  
This C program converts time given in **hours** to its equivalent in **minutes** and **seconds**. It uses simple arithmetic to compute the results:  
- **Minutes**: \(\text{Hours} \times 60\)  
- **Seconds**: \(\text{Minutes} \times 60\)  

### Features  
- Accepts time input in hours from the user.  
- Calculates and displays the equivalent time in minutes and seconds.  
- Provides a simple demonstration of basic arithmetic operations and formatted output.  

### Code Highlights  
- Demonstrates the use of `float` variables for handling decimal inputs and outputs.  
- Includes a clear prompt for user input using `printf`.  
- Uses comments for better code readability and context.  

### How to Run  
1. Copy the code into a `.c` file (e.g., `time_conversion.c`).  
2. Compile the file using a C compiler like GCC:  
   ```bash
   gcc time_conversion.c -o time_conversion
   ```  
3. Run the compiled program:  
   ```bash
   ./time_conversion
   ```  
4. Enter a value in hours when prompted, and view the converted time.  

### Example Output  
```
Please Enter any value for time : ____  
2  

The conversion of the time =2.000000 Hours is 120.000000 minutes, 7200.000000 Seconds  
```  

### Learning Objectives  
- Understanding basic arithmetic operations in C.  
- Utilizing `float` data type for precision in calculations.  
- Formatting user input and program output for better readability.
