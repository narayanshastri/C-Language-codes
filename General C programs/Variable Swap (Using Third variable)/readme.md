## Swap Two Variables Using a Temporary Variable  

### Overview  
This C program swaps the values of two variables using a **third variable (temporary storage)**. Swapping is a fundamental concept in programming, and this program demonstrates the process step by step.  

### Features  
- Accepts two integer inputs (`x` and `y`) from the user.  
- Swaps the values of `x` and `y` using a third variable (`temp`).  
- Displays the values of `x` and `y` before and after the swap operation.  

### Code Highlights  
- Utilizes a **temporary variable** to facilitate the swapping process.  
- Prompts the user with formatted inputs for an interactive experience.  
- Outputs the swapped values to verify the operation.  

### How to Run  
1. Copy the code into a `.c` file (e.g., `swap_variables.c`).  
2. Compile the file using a C compiler like GCC:  
   ```bash
   gcc swap_variables.c -o swap_variables
   ```  
3. Run the compiled program:  
   ```bash
   ./swap_variables
   ```  
4. Enter values for `x` and `y` when prompted to see their swapped values.  

### Example Output  
#### Input  
```
Please Enter any value for x: ____  
5  

Please Enter any value for y: ____  
3  
```  

#### Output  
```
Value Of x & y after Swap Is  x= 3 and y= 5  
```  

### Learning Objectives  
- Understand the swapping process using a **third variable**.  
- Practice the use of variables and assignments in C.  
- Learn how to work with formatted input and output.
