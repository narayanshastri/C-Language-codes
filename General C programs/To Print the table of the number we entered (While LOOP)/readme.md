## Multiplication Table Generator (While Loop)

### Overview  
This C program generates the multiplication table for a user-specified number using a `while` loop. The table displays the number multiplied by integers from 0 to 10, demonstrating the functionality of iterative control structures in C.  

### Features  
- Accepts a number as input from the user.  
- Uses a `while` loop to calculate and display the multiplication table.  
- Provides a formatted and structured output for better readability.  
- Ensures clarity in how iteration and condition checking work in C.  

### Code Highlights  
- **Input Handling**: Prompts the user to enter a number for which the table will be generated.  
- **Iterative Calculation**: A `while` loop ensures each step of the multiplication process is executed until the condition is met.  
- **Incremental Indexing**: Updates the multiplier (`Index`) within the loop to proceed to the next step.  

### How to Run  
1. Save the code in a `.c` file (e.g., `while_loop_table.c`).  
2. Compile the program using a C compiler, such as GCC:  
   ```bash
   gcc while_loop_table.c -o while_loop_table
   ```  
3. Execute the program:  
   ```bash
   ./while_loop_table
   ```  
4. Enter a number when prompted to generate its multiplication table.

### Example Output  
#### Input  
```
Please Enter any Value for the number: 7
```  

#### Output  
```
The table of the number you entered is as follows:
7 X 0 = 0
7 X 1 = 7
7 X 2 = 14
7 X 3 = 21
7 X 4 = 28
7 X 5 = 35
7 X 6 = 42
7 X 7 = 49
7 X 8 = 56
7 X 9 = 63
7 X 10 = 70
```  

### Learning Objectives  
- Explore the use of the `while` loop for repetitive tasks.  
- Understand conditional checks and loop incrementing in C.  
- Gain familiarity with user input and formatted output.  

### Notes  
- This implementation starts with a multiplier (`Index`) of 0. You can modify the starting value to 1 if required for specific use cases.  
- This program only supports integers. To handle decimals or other data types, further adjustments to the input and calculation logic are required.
